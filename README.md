**🔐 Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using Decision Tree**
**📌 Project Overview**
This project is a Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that detects malicious network traffic using the KDD Cup 99 dataset. It uses a Decision Tree Classifier to classify network activity as either normal or an attack, and further identifies the specific type of attack. The IDS is deployed through a user-friendly Flask web application, allowing users to enter network parameters and get predictions in real-time.

**🎯 Objectives**
To build an effective Intrusion Detection System using supervised learning.

To classify network traffic as normal or attack.

To further identify the type of attack using multi-class classification.

To provide an intuitive web interface for real-time predictions.

To raise awareness of cybersecurity threats through the Assist page.

**🧠 Machine Learning Model**
Algorithm Used: Decision Tree Classifier

Dataset: KDD Cup 1999 Dataset

Features Selected (Top 8 for simplicity & accuracy):

duration, protocol_type, service, flag, src_bytes, dst_bytes, count, srv_count

Label: Network traffic type (e.g., normal, neptune, smurf, satan, etc.)

**⚙️ How It Works**
**Data Preprocessing**

Load and label columns from the dataset.

Encode categorical features like protocol_type, service, and flag.

Select the top 8 most impactful features.

Split the data into training and test sets.

**Model Training**

Train a DecisionTreeClassifier on the selected features.

Save the trained model using joblib.

**Web Application (Flask)**

Home page allows users to input network parameters.

Model predicts whether the input is normal or an attack.

Result is displayed with clear classification (e.g., "🚨 Attack Detected: SATAN").

**Assist Page**

Educates users about the dataset features and common attack types.

Describes how the system works and its importance in real-world scenarios.
